### ELISA
ELISA is a lab inventory management app designed to improve the efficiency of Seattle Pacific University's ECS lab inventory management process. This application addresses pain points our client faced, including biased reporting, manual coordination, and difficulty tracking equipment. With ELISA, students can easily reserve necessary equipment, and the inventory manager can generate QR codes and barcodes for each item to monitor its usage and status. ELISA provides real-time data on inventory levels and sends notifications to students and the inventory manager regarding equipment and reservation statuses, streamlining the entire process and saving time.

### Course Flowchart
This project is designed to help students visualize the flow of courses required to complete two majors, Nursing and Information System. The program reads course information from two text files, major1.txt, and major2.txt, and visually represents the course dependencies. It also allows users to input their desired maximum number of credits per quarter and starting quarter, providing an outline of how to take the courses under these constraints.

Here is the demo on how to run the program in Windows Operating System (Click on the thumbnail below).
